# PRIMING HELP
Priming helps by putting the larger context into the memory of the LLM (context window), before asking questions from the LLM on the content. 

Useful for situations where you need to include larger contexts, such as analysing documents. 

## Example - Aligning your Teacher to the Strategic Plan specifically around Lead and Perform 

1. Download the [Chisholm Strategic Plan](https://mc-144d79d2-0071-496e-ac6f-746126-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/files/about/publications/strategic-plan.pdf?rev=4bf3e11fc31347f1a5b18decc821210a&hash=A977DA0ABCF8E1B44A5C2854C63CE8F5) 
2. Add the strategic plan pdf to the chat window
3. Use the PROMPT below to ask the LLM to produce you a plan on aligning to the Strategic Plan 

###INSTRUCTION###
I am a teacher at the institute that has produced this strategic plan pdf. Review the strategy plan and work out for me how I can align with it from the context of Lead and Perform. Be specific in your recommendations and ensure your recommendations are aligned to this strategy. You must be aligned with the advice. 

## Follow Ups
- Think of ways you can break out further the recommendations 
- Convert the content to other formats for easier implementation
